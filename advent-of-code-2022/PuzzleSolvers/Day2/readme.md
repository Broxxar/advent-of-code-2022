# Day 2

Cheating at Rock, Paper, Scissors seems like a good way to end up on the naughty list, but oh well!

My solution to the puzzle also felt a bit like cheating. I hummed and hawed for a minute before thinking I could just write out the solution pretty quickly in a Dictionary. With the 9 possible outcomes mapped out, the solution is trivial. Part Two was a matter of shuffling the numbers around to account for the change of rules.

Wasn't thrilled with my solve, but I managed to submit in 10:26 for a rank of 876. Having all the boilerplate set up so I can just implement the functions and run my code helped a lot, but if I want to get more competitive, I might need solutions which are slightly more clever than hard coding the answers! 😅
