# Day 1

Here we go! Since this is my first year doing AOC. I decided to use C#, my bread-and-butter language. I started super late so this day wasn't at all competitive. It took me longer to set up an environment and my little `IPuzzleSolver` than it took to actually solve today's puzzle! 😅

For the puzzle itself, it was easily expressed with LINQ. Most game developer's are used to avoiding LINQ because it tends to make many temporary allocations. Not here though! I challenged myself to do the puzzle in a single line and it worked out well. I might try that going forward, but undoubtedly will break that rule a bit if I'm trying to get a good time.

It'll be a balance of going fast and code golfing a bit, all the while having fun writing code in my favourite language!
