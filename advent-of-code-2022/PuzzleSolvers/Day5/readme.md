# Day 5
Scuffed. Disastrous. Messy.

Just a few words that might describe my Day 5 solve. The puzzle itself is not too complex, but parsing the input was a nightmare. I made a choice on Day 1 to trim white space for the input to all my solvers, which happened to be fine for the next few days, but broke down here.

I don't feel like I have the right tools to properly ingest this input into whatever intermediate data structures I wanted it in. I could probably do a bit better with my LINQ-fu, so maybe I'll come back and improve this one later.

Once I had things parsed into stacks, both parts we're pretty natural to express (though admittedly part two is a bit muddier than I'd prefer). Overall, lots of room for improvement, not my cleanest solve or fastest day.

Oh well!
