# Advent of Code 2022

---

Hello! I'm Dan, a staff engineer at [Riot Games](https://www.riotgames.com/en/work-with-us#craft=software-engineering-group). This is my first year doing AOC, and I'll be writing in C#. I've been a game developer for nearly 10 years, and much of that time was spent in the Unity game engine which also uses C#. As such, it's the language I've spent the most time in. I'm sure some languages like Python may be slightly better for quickly iterating on puzzle solutions, but ultimately my speed and familiarly with C# makes it my best bet for speed and correctness!

I'm hoping to complete all 25 days with little readme postmortems alongside each puzzle solver.

Playing along and want to share solutions? Hit me up on [Mastodon](https://mastodon.gamedev.place/@DanMoran)!

Cheers— and happy puzzling!
